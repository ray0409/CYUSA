        <p>History of Computers
        
        19th Century Beginnings The history of computers dates back to the early 19th century when mechanical calculating machines were first theorized and built. In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a loom that utilized punched cards for weaving fabric designs, laying the groundwork for future computing devices. Charles Babbage conceived the Difference Engine in 1821, a steam-driven machine intended to compute numerical tables, although it was never completed due to technological limitations.
        
        Pioneering Contributions In 1848, Ada Lovelace wrote what is considered the first computer program while translating a paper on Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine. This marked a significant milestone in computing history as she provided an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers. The late 19th century saw Herman Hollerith develop a punch-card system for the 1890 U.S. Census, which greatly expedited data processing and led to the formation of IBM.</p>
